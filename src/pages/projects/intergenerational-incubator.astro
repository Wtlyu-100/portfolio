      <h2>Concept</h2>
      <p>
        Use this section to write 2–4 short paragraphs describing the question the project starts from, the specific
        urban or social condition it works within, and the spatial system you propose in response.
      </p>
      <p>
        Keep each paragraph tight and legible. Think of it as if you are explaining the project to a studio critic who
        has 2 minutes before your review.

        Here you can briefly outline the steps that mattered: early site readings, physical or digital models,
        structural tests, or field observations that shifted the project.
